# My Claude Code Workflow: From Idea to Production

As a developer and IT professional, finding the right tools out of the sheer amount of options is exhausting. But the moment I integrated **Claude AI** into my development workflow, my team velocity transformed.

## The Problem
Before we adopted generative AI as a strict dependency for operations...

- We spent 30% of our week digging through internal documentation
- Debugging obscure build errors in OpenClaw components took an average of 4 hours
- Context switching destroyed sprint capacity

## The Solution
Instead of treating Claude like a gimmick, we wired it directly into our repositories.

Here is a snippet of how our automated review scripts look:
```javascript
const analyzePR = async (diffString) => {
  const result = await claude.messages.create({
    model: 'claude-3-opus-20240229',
    max_tokens: 1024,
    messages: [
      {
        role: 'user', 
        content: `Review this diff for security flaws:\n\n${diffString}`
      }
    ]
  });
  return result;
}
```

## Results
We saw a massive efficiency jump, meaning our Network Administrators focused on scaling infrastructure instead of parsing logs manually.
