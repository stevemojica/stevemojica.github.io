> Anthropic refused to let Claude power mass surveillance or autonomous weapons — even after the Pentagon threatened to blacklist them. Other AI companies took that contract the same day. This is why I use Claude. My tools should reflect my values. #Anthropic #Claude #AI

> Anthropic refused to let Claude be used for mass surveillance of U.S. citizens or fully autonomous weapons — even when the Pentagon threatened to blacklist them and the president ordered agencies to stop using their products. Within hours, other AI companies rushed to fill that contract. That says everything. The AI I use every day is built by people who believe some lines shouldn't be crossed. That matters to me. My tools should reflect my values. #Anthropic #Claude #AI #Ethics
